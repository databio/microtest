# This project config file describes all *project-specific variables*
# Its primary purpose as as input to Looper, which will submit jobs as appropriate
# for each sample in the project.
# But it is also read by other tools, including:
# - project sample loop (primary purpose)
# - make_trackhubs scripts to produce web accessible results
# - stats summary scripts
# - analysis scripts requiring pointers to metadata, results, and other options.

paths:
  # output_dir: ABSOLUTE PATH to the parent, shared space where project results go
  output_dir: projects/microtest
  # results and submission subdirs are subdirectors directories under parent output_dir
  # results: where output sample folders will go
  # submission: where cluster submit scripts and log files will go
  # results_subdir: results_pipeline
  # submission_subdir: pipelines/submission
  # pipelines_dir: ABSOLUTE PATH the directory where the Looper will find pipeline
  # scripts (and accompanying pipeline config files) for submission.
  pipelines_dir: ../../open_pipelines

metadata:
  # Elements in this section can be absolute or relative.
  # Typically, this project config file is stored with the project metadata, so
  # relative paths are considered relative to this project config file.
  # sample_annotation: one-row-per-sample metadata
  sample_annotation: microtest_annotation.csv
  # merge_table: input for samples with more than one input file
  # merge_table: null.csv
  # compare_table: comparison pairs or groups, like normalization samples
  # compare_table: null.csv

data_sources:
  # specify the ABSOLUTE PATH of input files using variable path expressions
  # entries correspond to values in the data_source column in sample_annotation table
  # {variable} can be used to replace environment variables or other sample_annotation columns
  # If you use {variable} codes, you should quote the field so python can parse it.
  bsf_samples: "{RAWDATA}{flowcell}/{flowcell}_{lane}_samples/{flowcell}_{lane}#{BSF_name}.bam"
